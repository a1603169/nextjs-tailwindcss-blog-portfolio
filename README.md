#### What is PWA ?

PWA stands for `Progressive Web Application`. It's a type of web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. 

These applications can be loaded like regular web pages, but offer functionalities such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications. 

PWAs are an emerging technology that combine the open standards of the web offered by modern browsers to provide benefits of a rich mobile experience.

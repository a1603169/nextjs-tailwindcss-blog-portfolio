## üåê What is a PWA?

**Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)** redefine how you interact with mobile apps by harnessing the capabilities of modern web technology. Unlike traditional applications, PWAs are accessible as regular web pages yet offer the rich, engaging experience you'd expect from a native app.

**Key Features of PWAs:**
- **Offline Functionality:** Access content without an internet connection.
- **Push Notifications:** Stay updated with timely notifications.
- **Device Hardware Access:** Utilize the full potential of your device.

PWAs represent the convergence of web standards and the mobile experience, providing the best of both worlds. Embrace the future of applications without sacrificing the perks of mobile usability.
